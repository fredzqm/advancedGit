The output of command is in file "result"
	 py -3.5 ..\grep-tree-contents_lab1.py -t 7d3b207 -s NOTE

When I run this in windows, sometimes it would throw an encoding error like:
	UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\ufb01' in position 6: character maps to <undefined>
I believe this happens due to the fact that windows console does not support unicode.
